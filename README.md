`Ping Dashboard` is a light explorer for Cosmos-based Blockchains.  https://ping.pub .

## What sets Ping Dashboard apart from other explorers?
**Ping Dashboard** stands out by providing a real-time exploration of blockchain data without relying on caching or pre-processing. It exclusively fetches data from the Cosmos full node via LCD/RPC endpoints, ensuring a truly authentic experience. This approach is referred to as the "Light Explorer."

## Why does Ping Dashboard rely on official/trusted third-party public LCD/RPC servers?
There are two primary reasons for this choice:

 - Trust: In a decentralized system, it is crucial to avoid relying solely on a single entity. By utilizing official/trusted third-party public LCD/RPC servers, Ping Dashboard ensures that the data is sourced from a network of trusted participants.
 - Limited Resources: As Ping Dashboard plans to list hundreds of Cosmos-based blockchains in the future, it is impractical for the Ping team to operate validators or full nodes for all of them. Leveraging trusted third-party servers allows for more efficient resource allocation.
